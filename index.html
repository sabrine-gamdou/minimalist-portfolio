            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm a computer science student, currently in my 3rd year. I'm an aspiring developer with focus on Java and the
                Spring Framework. I'm interested in full stack development and cloud services.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>

            <p><span style="color:cyan">Bash developer - <i class="fas fa-building"></i> Hochschule Bremen</span></p>
            <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i><span> 03.2021 - 04.2021</span>
            <p>I updated Bash scripts from RHEL7 to RHEL8 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux).
                The scripts are used in the Red Hat course “Red Hat Linux Administration”
                offered at the university. Those scripts were part of the practice
                environment and labs provided to help the students do exercises and
                participate in weekly tests.
            </p>

            <p><span style="color:cyan">Configuration Manager in a university project - <i class="fas fa-building"></i> Hochschule Bremen</span></p>
            <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i><span> 11.2020 - 02.2021</span>
            <p>I was responsible for the versioning of the source code and the documents
                during the BSAG-Intranet project using Github. I reviewed pull requests,
                solved conflicts, created short presentations for the team to assist them
                with the version control tool and assisted them with problems with
                Github.

            <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i><span> 10.2019 - 08.2020</span>
            <p>I assisted students in the java programming courses 1 & 2. I helped the
                students with the basics of the java language through preparing short
                cheat sheets of every lecture they had and exercises to practice what they
                learned. I later assisted them in developing a game written purely in java
                and using JavaFX.

                and Computer Science during the preparation course at the start of the
                semester.

            <a href="https://github.com/Projektmodul/Intranet">BSAG-Intranet in Spring Boot & Vaadin</a>
            <p><span>What is it?</span><br>
                An Content Management System, single page application
                created for the BSAG workers. This web application is user
                friendly and enables the users to navigate it smoothly.<br>
                <span>My Contribution:</span><br>
                I was responsible for most of the backend and the
                persistence layer of the web application and
                designed the application backend architecture. I
                developed reusable components to manage files and sync
                them between the database and the file server, and a
                notification system to notify the users of certain events.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/sabrine-gamdou/PersonalPlanner">Personal Planner in C++ & Qt</a>
            <p><span>What is it?</span><br>
                A desktop application that allows users to create an
                account, add personal tasks and manage them. The users
                have a tracked score to serve as a motivator to accomplish
                tasks and also a chart to provide the user with an overview
                of the past tasks over a period of time.<br>
                <span>My Contribution:</span><br>
                I designed the application architecture using UML and modeling tools. I developed the backend based on that
                architecture.</p>
