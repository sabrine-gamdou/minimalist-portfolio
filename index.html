            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm a computer science student, currently in my 3rd year. And an aspiring developer with focus on Java and the
                Spring Framework. I'm interested in developing front-end and back-end applications and cloud services.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>

            <p><span style="color:cyan">Configuration Manager in a university project <i class="fas fa-building"></i> Hochschule Bremen</span></p>
            <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i><span> 11.2020 - 02.2021</span>
            <p>I was responsible for the versioning of the source code and the documents
                during the BSAG-Intranet project using Github. I reviewed pull requests,
                solved conflicts, created short presentations for the team to assist them
                with the version control tool and assisted them with problems with
                Github.
            </p>

            <p><span style="color:cyan">Java Programming Tutor - <i class="fas fa-building"></i> Hochschule Bremen</span></p>
            <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i><span> 10.2019 - 08.2020</span>
            <p>I assisted students in the java programming courses 1 & 2. I helped the
                students with the basics of the java language through preparing short
                cheat sheets of every lecture they had and exercises to practice what they
                learned. I later assisted them in developing a game written purely in java
                and using JavaFX.

            <p>I assisted the new coming students in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering
                and Computer Science during the preparation course at the start of the
                semester.

            <a href="https://github.com/Projektmodul/Intranet">BSAG-Intranet in Spring Boot & Vaadin</a>
            <p><span>What is it?</span><br>
                An Content Management System, single page application
                created for the BSAG workers. This web application is user
                friendly and enables the users to navigate it smoothly.<br>
                <span>My Contribution:</span><br>
                I was responsible for most of the backend and the
                persistence layer of the web application and
                designed the application backend architecture. I
                developed reusable components to manage files and sync
                them between the database and the fileserver, and a
                notification system to notify the users of certain events.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/sabrine-gamdou/PersonalPlanner">Personal Planner in C++ & Qt</a>
            <p><span>What is it?</span><br>
                A desktop application that allows users to create an
                account, add personal tasks and manage them. The users
                have a tracked score to serve as a motivator to accomplish
                tasks and also a chart to provide the user with an overview
                of the past tasks over a period of time.<br>
                <span>My Contribution:</span><br>
                I designed the application architecture using UML and modeling tools. I developed the backend based on that
                architecture.</p>
